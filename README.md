# Binance to Google Sheets!

A lightweight **Google Spreadsheets Add-On** to GET data _directly_ from **Binance API** _without_ any intermediaries!

> Since Binance decided to **block API requests** coming from restricted countries like USA (from which the Google servers in where our spreadsheets run are located), you'll probably need a proxy.  
Check [Binance to Google Sheets Add-On Proxy](https://github.com/diegomanuel/binance-to-google-sheets-proxy) for a basic proxy server implementation that I did for myself and is currently working fine. It may be useful for you too!  
See the [README.md](https://github.com/diegomanuel/binance-to-google-sheets-proxy#readme) for further details.

This `add-on` is basically an **API client** specially hand-crafted to work between Google Spreadsheets and Binance.  
By using the `BINANCE()` formula in your spreadsheet, you can get data fetched from Binance API like:  
* Current market [prices](#operation-prices-public)
* Historical market [OHLCV](#operation-history-public)
* Last [24h stats](#operation-stats24h-public)
* Total [account assets](#operation-account-private) from Binance wallets (SPOT + EARN + CROSS + ISOLATED + FUTURES + SUB-ACCOUNTS)
* All current [open orders](#operation-ordersopen-private) (SPOT + CROSS + ISOLATED + FUTURES)
* Latest [done/finished orders](#operation-ordersdone-private) (SPOT + CROSS + ISOLATED + FUTURES)
* Historical [orders table](#operation-orderstable-private) (SPOT + CROSS + ISOLATED + FUTURES)
* Last data [update time](#operation-last_update-public) and current [add-on version](#operation-version-public) being used
* ..and many more to come!

At first glance, **NO Binance API key** is needed to call **public endpoints** like [current prices](#operation-prices-public), [historic prices](#operation-history-public) and [24h stats](#operation-stats24h-public).   
It **only** requires a [Binance API key](#binance-api-key) for **private endpoints** like [account info](#operation-account-private) and [open/done/table orders](#operation-ordersopen-private), but a **READ-ONLY** API key is enough for everything to work.  
In deed, I _personally recommend_ to generate a **READ-ONLY** API key at Binance site [here](https://www.binance.com/en/usercenter/settings/api-management).  
It does **NOT need** write/trade access **in ANY way** to properly work with all its features, so don't give extra permissions if they aren't needed!

I think and hope that many of you will find it as useful as it is for myself.  
Enjoy, cheers! :beers:


## How can I use it in my Google Spreadsheets?

First of all, open your desired Google Spreadsheet and configure it properly:
1. Go to `File -> Spreadsheet settings`.
2. Under the `Calculation` tab set the `Recalculation` combobox to `On change and every minute`.
3. Hit `Save settings` button and continue with the steps below!

### The quick'n easy way for everybody

Just [download the latest **BINANCE.gs**](https://github.com/diegomanuel/binance-to-google-sheets/releases/latest/download/BINANCE.gs) _all-in-one_ file + [**appsscript.json**](https://github.com/diegomanuel/binance-to-google-sheets/releases/latest/download/appsscript.json) and **copy & paste** its contents following these steps:

1. With your desired `Google Spreadsheet` opened, go to `Tools -> Script editor`.
    * It should open an editor in a new page with a `Code.gs` file containing an empty function.
    * Remove any contents from `Code.gs` and save the project at `File -> Save`. Give any name you want.
2. Go to project properties and make sure to select `Show "appsscript.json" manifest file in editor` checkbox.
3. Go back to code editor, select the `Code.gs` file and paste the contents from the downloaded `BINANCE.gs` file.
4. Do the same for `appsscript.json` and optionally set your desired timezone.
5. Save the project again and refresh/reload your Google Spreadsheet (hit `F5` on the browser).
    * Once reloaded, you should see a little message box (toast) at the bottom-right corner.
6. Go to `Binance` item at your spreadsheet's main menu and click on the `Authorize add-on!` item.
7. A Google's dialog should appear asking for permissions, proceed with all the steps and click `Allow`.
    * The popup will close and nothing will change on your spreadsheet yet!
8. Once the add-on is authorized, repeat step `5` (click `Authorize add-on!` again) and voila!

### If you are a developer  =]

You will need [node](https://nodejs.org) and [clasp](https://github.com/google/clasp) in order to apply the `add-on` to your Google Spreadsheets.  

1. Install `node` and `clasp` following their simple setup guides.
2. Clone the `repo` and login to your Google account with `clasp` by running: `clasp login`.
3. Get the `Script ID` for your desired Google Spreadsheet.
    1. With your `Google Spreadsheet` open, go to `Tools -> Script editor`.
    2. At the `Google Script` screen, go to `File -> Project properties`.
    3. The needed ID is the one under the `Script ID` label!
    4. Make sure to select `Show "appsscript.json" manifest file in editor` checkbox.
4. Just for the first time, run the target `make setup SCRIPT_ID=my-script-id` replacing `my-script-id` with the ID obtained at point `3`.
    * It should create the file `.clasp.json` with your `scriptId` inside for future use.
    * **NOTE:** You only need to re-run this step if you want to change the configured `scriptId`.
5. Now you can run `make push` (or just `make` alone) to upload/apply local code to your desired Google Spreadsheet!
    * From now on, you can just run `make` to keep applying changes to the same configured spreadsheet.
    * **TIP:** You can run `make update` to pull latest changes from this repo and push them to your configured spreadsheet.
6. Refresh/reload your Google Spreadsheet (hit `F5` on the browser).
    * Once reloaded, you should see a little message box (toast) at the bottom-right corner.
7. Go to `Binance` item at your spreadsheet's main menu and click on the `Authorize add-on!` item.
8. A Google's dialog should appear asking for permissions, proceed with all the steps and click `Allow`.
    * The popup will close and nothing will change on your spreadsheet yet!
9. Once the add-on is authorized, repeat step `7` (click `Authorize add-on!` again) and voila!

**Windows users:** You can download and use `make` from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32/files/make/3.81/) or even the entire [GnuWin](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32/) toolset.


### Troubleshoot

Please take a look to the logs before opening an issue!  
https://script.google.com/u/0/home/executions

I'll try to answer all your questions but it takes time, dedication and effort to be there, so plz be patient!  
The add-on is working in a stable manner and the only recurrent problem is the `418` and `403` responses from Binance API, but there is nothing we can do since our spreadsheets runs on shared Google servers whose IP addresses are shared among all the Google users.


### Binance API Key

Only needed if you **also want** to call **private endpoints** from your spreadsheet.  
To get your keys, go to [Binance API panel](https://www.binance.com/en/usercenter/settings/api-management) and create a new one:

1. Enter a label like `Binance to Google Sheets` and click the `Create` button.
2. Take note for both `API Key` and `Secret Key` values.
3. Click the `Edit restrictions` button.
    1. Under `API restrictions` **ONLY** `Can Read` checkbox should be checked.  
    2. Under `IP access restrictions` select `Unrestricted`.
    3. Enable **futures** (read-only) if you also want to fetch data from there.
4. Click the `Save` button and now you have to configure them on your spreadsheet!

Once you have the `add-on` already installed/enabled on your desired Google Spreadsheet, the main menu item `Binance` should have appeared at the rightmost position.

1. At spreadsheet's main menu, go to `Binance -> Setup API Keys`.
2. Set your `API Key` and click `OK`. Do the same for `API Secret Key`.
3. Voila, you are ready to go!

**NOTE:** You can remove or re-configure them at any time from the `Binance` main menu item in your spreadsheet.


## OK, I have it installed! How do I use it at my spreadsheet?

**NOTE:** Check the **`Examples` sheet** in the **[live DEMO](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AcOcPFsncrDB_ve3wWMHwfiFql6A4hmG1sFc01LLTDg/edit#gid=1522299933)  spreadsheet** for more details.

You just need to call the `=BINANCE()` formula in a cell!  
Some operations are **public**, meaning they **don't need a Binance API key** to call'em.  
Some operations are **private**, meaning they **do require a Binance API key** to call'em.

**So far, these are the available operations:**

### Operation: `"version"` (public)
`=BINANCE("version")` will return the current `Binance to Google Sheets` version you are running.
* Be sure to check the [latest release](https://github.com/diegomanuel/binance-to-google-sheets/releases/latest) and update yours if needed.

### Operation: `"last_update"` (public)
`=BINANCE("last_update")` will return the timestamp of the last request/response from Binance API.
* The timestamp is updated every time we get a valid response from Binance API (status `200`, no matter what operation triggered it).

### Operation: `"prices"` (public)
`=BINANCE("prices")` will return a list with the latest prices from Binance.
* `=BINANCE("prices", "BTC")` Optionally you can give a symbol to just return its price (against `USDT` by default).
* `=BINANCE("prices", "BNB", "BTC")` Optionally you can give a ticker to compare against and to just return its price.
* `=BINANCE("prices", A1:A3)` Optionally you can give a ticker range to return a list of symbols and prices.
    * Values must be simple symbols like `A1="BTC"`, `A2="ETH"` and `A3="LTC"`.
* `=BINANCE("prices", A1:A3, "headers: false")` Optionally you can give more options like not returning table headers.
* `=BINANCE("prices", A1:A3, "ticker: BNB, prices: true")` Optionally you can return only the prices (and give a ticker in the meantime).

### Operation: `"history"` (public)
`=BINANCE("history", "BTCUSDT", "interval: 1h, limit: 24")` will return a list with the latest **24hr** OHLCV **hourly** data for given **full symbol/ticker** from Binance.  
* The **2nd** parameter is **required** and it must be a **valid** single full symbol/ticker, like: `"BTCUSDT"`, `"ETHBTC"`, etc.
* The **3rd** parameter supports the following options, in a single string separated by commas:
    * `"interval: 15m"`: Can be any supported value by Binance API, like: `1m`, `5m`, `1h`, `1d`, etc. Defaults to: `1h`
    * `"start: 2021-01-01"`: Optional. The start date/time to get data from. Can be any supported value by `new Date(value)` JS object, like: `2021-01-01-11-22-33` (time is converted to `:` format).
    * `"end: 2021-01-31"`: Optional. The end date/time to get data from. The same supported values as `start` option.
    * `"limit: 10"`: Optional. How many rows to return, from `1` to `1000`, defaults to: `500`.
    * `"headers: false"`: Don't return table headers.
* **IMPORTANT:** If any parameter value is wrong, Binance API will answer with a `400` status code.

### Operation: `"stats/24h"` (public)
`=BINANCE("stats/24h", A1:A3)` will return a list with the 24hs stats for given symbols from Binance.
* A single value like `"BTC"` or a range of values is **required**. Values must be simple symbols like `A1="BTC"`, `A2="ETH"` and `A3="LTC"`.
* `=BINANCE("stats/24h", A1:A3, "BTC")` Optionally you can give a ticker to match against (defaults to `USDT`).
* `=BINANCE("stats/24h", A1:A3, "ticker: BTC, headers: false")` Optionally you can give more options like not returning table headers.

### Operation: `"account"` (private)
`=BINANCE("account")` will return total account assets from Binance wallets (SPOT + EARN + CROSS + ISOLATED + FUTURES + SUB-ACCOUNTS).
* `=BINANCE("account", "spot")` Display assets summary for SPOT wallet.
* `=BINANCE("account", "earn")` Display assets summary for EARN (flexible+locked) wallet.  
**NOTE:** Just 100 items from flexible and 100 from locked. This needs to be improved by adding pagination support when calling Binance API.
* `=BINANCE("account", "cross")` Display assets summary for CROSS MARGIN wallet.
    * If you don't use this wallet (0 assets there), you should disable it from "Binance->Wallets" main menu.
* `=BINANCE("account", "isolated")` Display assets summary for ISOLATED MARGIN wallet.
    * If you don't use this wallet (0 assets there), you should disable it from "Binance->Wallets" main menu.
* `=BINANCE("account", "futures")` Display assets summary for FUTURES wallet.
    * `=BINANCE("account", "futures/positions")` Display current positions summary.
    * If you don't use this wallet (0 assets there), you should disable it from "Binance->Wallets" main menu.
* `=BINANCE("account", "sub")` Display assets summary for added SUB-ACCOUNT wallets.
    * You can manually add/remove sub-accounts from "Binance->Sub-Accounts" main menu.
* `=BINANCE("account", "", "headers: false")` Optionally you can give more options like not returning table headers.

### Operation: `"orders/open"` (private)
`=BINANCE("orders/open")` will return a list with all your open/pending orders from Binance (SPOT + CROSS + ISOLATED + FUTURES).
* `=BINANCE("orders/open", "BTC")` Optionally you can give a **symbol** to filter the results (regexp).
    * `=BINANCE("orders/open", "B")` Will match any pair containing the letter `B`.
    * `=BINANCE("orders/open", "BTC")` Will match any pair having `BTC` somewhere (like `BTCUSDT`, `BTCBUSD`, `ETHBTC`, ...).
    * `=BINANCE("orders/open", A1:A3)` The same as above, but for multiple symbols in the range.
* `=BINANCE("orders/open", A1:A3, "headers: false, ticker: BTC")` Optionally you can give more options like not returning table headers and filtering by multiple symbols against `BTC` ticker (none by default).

### Operation: `"orders/table"` (private)
`=BINANCE("orders/table", MySheet!A1:A3)` will **transform** the current sheet into a **"table"** in where ALL historic done/finished orders will be periodically polled and stored for each given symbol from Binance (SPOT + CROSS + ISOLATED + FUTURES).
* This formula **must always** be placed at `A1` in any new blank sheet into your spreadsheet.
* A single value like `"BTC"` or a range of values is **required**. Values must be simple symbols like `MySheet!A1="BTC"`, `MySheet!A2="ETH"` and `MySheet!A3="LTC"`.
* Be patient! It will adjust sheet's cols/rows and initialize a table header for you.
* Do **NOT** alter the table data by hand! It will **poll for data** every `10` minutes automatically and it will keep it ordered by date.
* `=BINANCE("orders/table", MySheet!A1:A3, "BTC")` Optionally you can give a ticker to match against (defaults to `USDT`).
    * **WARNING:** Make sure that **ALL** trading pairs exist on Binance platform to avoid errors!
* `=BINANCE("orders/table", "BTC, ETH", "ticker: BUSD, unchanged: false")` Optionally you can skip unchanged assets check to always force to fetch for new orders.
    * **WARNING:** The `unchanged` mechanism exists to try to optimize the number of requests needed to fetch orders from large ranges with many pairs.  
    You _could_ manually disable it if your range is _small_ with just a few trading pairs (5 at most).  
    If you disable it and the range is not small, you could start having problems with `418` responses from Binance API or execution timeouts.. so use it with caution!
    * Note the usage of the string `"BTC, ETH"` instead of a range as a 2nd parameter.
* `=BINANCE("orders/table", "BTCBUSD, ETHBTC", "ticker: range")` Optionally you set `range` as **ticker** and provide **full pairs** as 2nd parameter, but only recommended for a few pairs.
    * **WARNING:** Using like this will **void the optimization** for unchanged assets.. so use it with caution!
    * You can also use a range `MySheet!A1:A2` in which each cell has full pair values like `MySheet!A1="BTCBUSD"` and `MySheet!A2="ETHBTC"`.

    **NOTE:** You can have **multiple sheets** with this formula on, they will be all polled every `10` minutes.  
    If you trade against multiple pairs, it's recommended to have **one** sheet **per each** pair. Example:  
    If you have trades for: `BTCUSDT`, `ETHUSDT`, `ETHBTC` and `BNBETH`  
    Having this values for `MySheet!A1:A3` range: `A1="BTC"`, `A2="ETH"` and `A3="BNB"`  
    You could create **3 sheets** like:  
    * `=BINANCE("orders/table", MySheet!A1:A3)` will fetch orders for: `BTCUSDT`, `ETHUSDT` and `BNBUSDT` (although you didn't traded this last one)
    * `=BINANCE("orders/table", MySheet!A2:A3, "BTC")` will fetch orders for: `ETHBTC` and `BNBBTC` (although you didn't traded this last one)
    * `=BINANCE("orders/table", "BNB", "ETH")` will fetch orders JUST for: `BNBETH`
    
    You could even have **one sheet per each symbol**, like following the example above:  
    * `=BINANCE("orders/table", "BTC", "USDT")`
    * `=BINANCE("orders/table", "ETH", "USDT")`
    * `=BINANCE("orders/table", "ETH", "BTC")`
    * `=BINANCE("orders/table", "BNB", "ETH")`

    But if you have _MANY_ trading symbols, I don't know how well it could behave!  
    The best option is to try to "merge" as much as you can in a single sheet with JUST the traded symbols for each one.

### Operation: `"orders/done"` (private)
**IMPORTANT:** It now requires at least **ONE sheet** in the spreadsheet with the **`"orders/table"`** operation in it!  
It will take **ALL** your sheets that have the **`"orders/table"`** operation (aka: "order table sheets") and it will summarize them for you in a single table.  
* `=BINANCE("orders/done")` Will return a list with your most recent (`100` by default) done/finished orders from ALL `"orders/table"` sheets in the spreadsheet.
* `=BINANCE("orders/done", "BTC")` Optionally you can give a **symbol** to filter the results (regexp).
    * `=BINANCE("orders/done", "B")` Will match any pair containing the letter `B`.
    * `=BINANCE("orders/done", "BTC")` Will match any pair having `BTC` somewhere (like `BTCUSDT`, `BTCBUSD`, `ETHBTC`, ...).
    * `=BINANCE("orders/done", A1:A3)` The same as above, but for multiple symbols in the range.
* `=BINANCE("orders/done", A1:A3, "headers: false, ticker: BTC, max: 0")` Optionally you can give more options like not returning table headers, filtering by multiple symbols against `BTC` ticker (none by default) and displaying ALL orders.
* Values for `max` allowed between `0` (unlimited/all) and `1000` (defaults to `100`).

## Some background: Why this tool had ever to come alive?!

I needed a way to have Binance data directly available at my Google Spreadsheet.  
First, I've looked for several existing solutions, but none provided me the _freedom_, _confidence_ and _privacy_ that I want for this kind of _delicate_ stuff.  
It's a requirement for me that requests to Binance go **directly** from my spreadsheet to its API without **any** intermediary _service_ in between (most than Google itself in where the spreadsheet resides, of course).  
So I decided to write my own code, all from scratch, with only my will and my javascript knownledge aboard..  
..and I was so happy with the results that I simply decided to share it to the world! :tada:


## Disclaimer

I'm just a guy that uses both services and wanted to have **Binance** data available at my personal **Google Spreadsheet**.  
I did it for myself and I liked it so much, that I decided to share it so anyone can use it!

The script only needs **READ** access keys to **Binance API**, so there is **no security concerns** about what the script is able to do at Binance in your behalf.  
It will just **retrieve** useful Binance data for your enjoyment in your spreadsheets.  =]
